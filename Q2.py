# Given a string a, find the longest palindromic substring contained in a. Your function definition should look like question2(a), and return a string.

def question2(a):
# Steps might be:

# Split the string in half, check if the reverse of this half is in the rest of the string

# Do this recursively and iteratively with successively smaller substrings at different frames within the string until we've exahusted the possibilities for two letters
